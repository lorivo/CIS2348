# Homework 2 for CIS 2348
***
## Part A. 
The assignment requires outputting dates inputted by the user that follows a specific format and is no later than the present day.
The code includes comments explaining the functions used. 
A while loop is used to ensure the code keeps asking for user input until '-1' is given and if statements are used to check the requirements.

## Part B.
3 lines were added in the beginning for part b, which reads files and inputs each line into a list. The rest of the code following that is adjusted so that givenstring is each part of the list and some of the indexes are adjusts because the end of each lsit now includes \n.

## Part C.
About 4 lines were added onto part b, which creates a new file, writes the output into it, and closes that file at the end of the code.
