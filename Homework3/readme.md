This folder contains the labs for Homework 3.

**Lab 10.11**
This lab mostly focusses on formatting and simple class use.

**Lab 10.15**
This lab is similar to lab 10.11, in which it's mostly formatting and class practice.

**Lab 10.17**
This lab wanted to create a class that holds items in a cart and output information about the class.

**Lab 10.19**
This lab is an addition to lab 10.19, but requires a menu with options to adjust the cart. Initially, I created the code with a reference to a class instead of an instance method.

**Lab 11.18**
This lab required splitting the user input into a list and appending specific information to a new list.

**Lab 11.22**
This code split information into a list and stated how many variables are in the list.

**Lab 11.27**
This lab makes a team roster and includes a menu to adjust the roster.
